'''Write a program that gets an integer N > 1 from the user and computes the average 
of all integers I = 1, â€¦ , N. The computation should be done in a function that takes 
N as input parameter. Print the result to the screen with an appropriate text. Run the 
program with N=5 and confirm that you get the correct answer.
